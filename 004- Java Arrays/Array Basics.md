## Array


**What is Array ?**

---

Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has a contiguous memory location.

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array. Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index, and so on.


**Why we need array ?**

---

Arrays in Java are essential data structures that allow us to store and manage multiple elements of the same data type in a single variable. They provide efficient memory allocation and fast access to elements, making it easier to work with collections of data and perform various operations like sorting, searching, and iteration.



**Types of Array in Java**

---

There are two types of arrays in Java:

   1. Single dimensional array in Java
  2.  Multi dimensional array in Java

**Advantages of using Java arrays**

---

- Arrays help to increase code optimization
- It helps in ordering and indexing data structure to store a particular type of element
- It can also store variables and objects of class in java
- Every element of an array is held in a definite memory location 


**Disadvantages of using Java arrays**

---

- An array can only hold the same type of elements
- Removing and adding elements in very tough
