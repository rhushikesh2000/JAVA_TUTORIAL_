**Aggregation**

---

- It represents Has-Aâ€™s relationship.
- It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
- In Aggregation, both entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.

**Understanding meaningful example of Aggregation**

In this example, Employee has an object of Address, address object contains its own informations such as city, state, country etc. In such case relationship is Employee HAS-A address.

Address.java
~~~java
public class Address {  
String city,state,country;  
  
public Address(String city, String state, String country) {  
    this.city = city;  
    this.state = state;  
    this.country = country;  
}  
  
}  
~~~
Emp.java
~~~java
public class Emp {  
int id;  
String name;  
Address address;  
  
public Emp(int id, String name,Address address) {  
    this.id = id;  
    this.name = name;  
    this.address=address;  
}  
  
void display(){  
System.out.println(id+" "+name);  
System.out.println(address.city+" "+address.state+" "+address.country);  
}  
  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
Address address1=new Address("gzb","UP","india");  
Address address2=new Address("gno","UP","india");  
  
Emp e=new Emp(111,"varun",address1);  
Emp e2=new Emp(112,"arun",address2);  
      
e.display();  
e2.display();  
      
}  
}  
~~~
Output:
~~~
111 varun
 gzb UP india
 112 arun
gno UP india   
~~~
**Composition**

---

- Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.

- It represents part-of relationship.
- In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
- When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.

**Let's take an example of a university and its colleges to understand the concept of Composition.**

We create a class College that contains variables, i.e., name and address. We also create a class University that has a reference to refer to the list of colleges. A University can have more than one collages. So, if a university is permanently closed, then all colleges within that particular university will be closed because colleges cannot exist without a university. The relationship between the university and colleges is Composition.

CompositionExample.java

~~~java
import java.io.*;   
import java.util.*;   
// class College  
class College {   
    public String name;   
    public String address;   
    College(String name, String address)   
    {   
        this.name = name;   
        this.address = address;   
    }   
}   
// University has more than one college.   
class University {   
    // reference to refer to list of college.   
    private final List<College> colleges;   
    University(List<College> colleges)  
    {  
        this.colleges = colleges;  
    }   
    // Getting total number of colleges  
    public List<College> getTotalCollegesInUniversity()   
    {   
        return colleges;   
    }   
}   
class CompositionExample {   
    public static void main(String[] args)   
    {   
        // Creating the Objects of College class.   
        College c1   
            = new College("ABES Engineering College", "Ghaziabad");   
        College c2   
            = new College("AKG Engineering College", "Ghaziabad");   
        College c3 = new College("ACN College of Engineering & Management Sudies",   
                           "Aligarh");   
        // Creating list which contains the no. of colleges.   
        List<College> college = new ArrayList<College>();   
        college.add(c1);   
        college.add(c2);   
        college.add(c3);   
        University university = new University(college);   
        List<College> colleges = university.getTotalCollegesInUniversity();   
        for (College cg : colleges) {   
            System.out.println("Name : " + cg.name   
                               + " and "  
                               + " Address : " + cg.address);   
        }   
    }   
}
~~~
Output:
~~~java
Gaziabad
gaziabad
